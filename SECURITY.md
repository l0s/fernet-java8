# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest minor version of Fernet Java is supported. If a security update
is implemented that requires no client code changes, then a new patch
version will be released. If a security update requires changing the client
interface, then there will be either a major or minor revision bump.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >= 1.4.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.4.x   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To privately report a vulnerability, please submit a
[security advisory](https://github.com/l0s/fernet-java8/security/advisories).
For details on how to do that, refer to
[GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

If you prefer not to report through GitHub, you may send an email to the
address associated with this [PGP key](https://openpgpkey.carlos-m.net/.well-known/openpgpkey/carlos-m.net/hu/c13mpwjm93f4i3644xebt6gm64aqxenr).

I will do my best to respond to reports within a week. Once acknowledged, I
will work with the reporter to release a fix.
